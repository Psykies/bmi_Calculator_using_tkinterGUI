# BMI Index Calculator

This program calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on height and weight input using a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Run the Python script `main.py`.
3. Enter your height in feet and inches.
4. Enter your weight in kilograms.
5. Click on the "Calculate" button to see your BMI.
6. A message box will display your BMI along with a description and optimal weight range for your height.
7. Click on the "Reset" button to clear the input fields.

## Understanding BMI Calculation

The BMI is calculated by dividing an adult's weight in kilograms by their height in meters squared. For example, if you weigh 70kg (around 11 stone) and are 1.73m (around 5 foot 8 inches) tall, you work out your BMI by squaring your height in meters: 1.73 x 1.73 = 2.99.

## BMI Categories

- **Underweight**: BMI less than 18.5
- **Normal weight**: BMI between 18.5 and 24.9
- **Overweight**: BMI between 25 and 29.9
- **Obese**: BMI 30 or greater

## Optimal Weight Range

The optimal weight range for a given height is calculated using the BMI values for normal weight (18.5 to 24.9) and the formula: BMI = weight / (height * height).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

## Code Structure

The program consists of functions to calculate BMI, describe BMI categories, and determine the optimal weight range. It also includes a graphical user interface (GUI) with input fields for height and weight, buttons to calculate and reset, and labels to display the results.
